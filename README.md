# The-Super-Universe
The Super Universe is an application where you'll be able to search your favorite Heroes or Villains. With all sorts of facts, and if you sign up you will be able to edit the heroes that are already in our database. And if you just don't want to edit known Heroes/Villains information, you can go all out and create your own hero in the application, to putting all sorts of facts about your character! Once you do, everybody will be able to see your character and maybe get inspired to create their own as well!
